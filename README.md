#### 🙌 HUGE credit to *Alexander Plyuto* for this very cool design! Check his *[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dvlvwe/)* and *[dribbble](https://dribbble.com/alexplyuto)*.
 
# Infos
I was really inspired by the mockup *Alexander Plyuto* posted on his instagram recently and decided to bring them to life ✨.
I try to stick as close a possible to the original design with the exception of the icon set which come from *[feathericons](https://feathericons.com/)*.

This is just an excercice for me, I got no intention to sell or promote things (other than my incredible skill 😜).
